One of the fun thing I like about linux is, the ability to choose window-manager and configure them the way we like. Also it has lots of window-manager to choose from. You don't have to live your whole life using same default window-manager. You can always try out different window-manager, tweak them and figure out which window-manager works best for you.

I3 is one of the best window-manager I have come across. It is simple light weight and easy to configure. The tiling window feature is its main feature.

I am a web developer. I write code using my code editor(normally atom) and use browser(normally firefox) to view the output. I normally like to view the output in the browser when I make changes to my code. In normal(non-tiling ) desktop-manager, I would have to drag my browser to one side of the screen and the editor to the other and resize them in such a way that they don't overlap.
In I3 I don't need to do the dragging and resizing to prevent overlapping. If I open two program-windows in same screen, they automatically gets tiled by default, occupying equal half of screen with no overlaps. I can also easily switch between horizontal and vertical tiling. And the fun part is dividing windows with suitable ratios.

Switching the active window is also much easier here. In normal desktop-manager, I will be using something like *Alt+Tab*. This method is highly unpredictable as the window which recently got inactive gets switched first. This becomes frustrating when you have lots of inactive windows and can't remember the order at which the windows became inactive.
In I3 this is not the problem as you don't have to remember the order here. You can simply use *Mode+Direction* key to switch the window.

While working, sometimes I need to focus on only one window. This can be easily achieved in i3 by pressing *Mod+F* keys. This will toggle between full-screen mode and normal mode. No double tapping in title bar required.
