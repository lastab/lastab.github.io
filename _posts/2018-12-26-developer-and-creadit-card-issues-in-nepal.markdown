## Developer and Creadit Card issues in Nepal
Due to some government policy, it is really difficult to obtain a creadit card which can be used for international purpose in Nepal. Currently the cards we can create here can only be used within Nepal and some neighbouring countries. We can’t use to buy products from international market like Amazon and Alibaba. Currently the simplest way to get a card which works internationally is by visiting other countries and creating the card there during the visit.

Not being able to obtain such card easily is a pain for normal Neplese people but is extremely difficult if the person happen to become a learning and new developer. It is extremely difficult to purchase products like e-books, specific softwares, specific hardwares and services from international market, that a normal developer requires without such cards.

Some opensource softwares and some limited free services has helped us developer a lot as they do not charge inorder to use it. We can easily use such services and move towards achiving our goals. But there are still some services which are free but requires card inorder to use it. Services like Heroku provides some awsome features which is free and does not require card inorder to use it. But thre are also some features which is free but requires card entry to use it. Other than heroku there are other company like AWS and Google Cloud that gives away some credit for free which can be used by us developer to learn and use those services. But the catch here is that it requires card number inorder to register and be able to use such credit. I myself had tried to register and obtain such credit but was unable to move forward just because I don’t have the card to get registered.

Not having card normally affect the publishing process and does not normally affect the developing and running code in local computer. Because to this you can easily find programmer who can write code but it is extremely difficult to find the programmer who know how to deploy the code in real server and perform essential operations there. I myself have written some good progams but haven’t been able to publish it to server.

One of the way to obtain such card is by applying for cards like master card through different country and ask to deliver the card to the post box. One of my friend tried this method. He finally got the card after waiting for a month or so. But when he tried to activate it, he found out that he didn’t even have the minimum balance to activate it.

The other thing that you can do, if you don’t have such card is by finding a middle man with the card who is willing to help. And most often the middle man charges a good chunk of money for it, increasing the cost and making things more expensive than it normally should be. I have seen some of my friends who tried this method to obtain products/services from international market.

Not having such cards not only hinder the buying process but also affects the earning process. I have a friend who does not work under any company and work as freelancing developer. He is an android developer and is really good at it. Normally he works for international clients and his earning is more than that if he had worked under a local software company. But the problem here is that, even though he earned a lot, when he tries to cash out he looses a large chunck of the income leaving him ammount a lot lesser than if he had worked under some local software company.

These are some of the issues that a new developer has to face if a developer does not own a international card. Hope that someday this issue would dissipear.
