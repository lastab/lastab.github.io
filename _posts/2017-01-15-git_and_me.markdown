#Before I Met GIT

There used to be a time when I didn't know a thing about git. I also didn't know why version controls were needed projects. In those days I only used to write small codes which does simple things. Those codes were quite easy to maintain. Slowly I started writing codes for complex(compared to my previous programs) projects. I started to feel that those codes were hard to maintain. Before I add new things in the project I need to manually make a copy of the project as a backup. There were high chances that I would mess up those code make my life a living hell. My folder containing the project would look something like this.

This confused me a lot. Sometimes I used to forget in which copy my latest changes were on. Then I started using time-stamps on the name of the copy of the project folders. This made my life a litter better but number of copy of backup folders increased in such a way that it started getting out of hand filling the hard disk of my computer.
